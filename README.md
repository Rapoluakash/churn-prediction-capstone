1. **`main.yml` is in the correct folder**  
   ✔️ You have it in `.github/workflows/` — ✅ Correct placement!

2. **Your Python script and CSV are in the root directory**  
   ✔️ `customer_churn_xgboost.py`  
   ✔️ `Churn_Modelling.csv`  
   ✅ Perfect!

3. **Now just make sure the Python script loads the CSV like this:**

```python
data = pd.read_csv("Churn_Modelling.csv")
```

**No Windows path (`C:\...`) allowed** on GitHub Actions — just use the relative filename.

# Customer Churn Prediction using XGBoost 🧠📉

This capstone project predicts customer churn using machine learning and ensemble techniques, specifically XGBoost.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- Dataset: Bank Customer Churn
- Goal: Predict whether a customer will leave the bank
- Techniques: Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, XGBoost Classifier
- Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

## 🧾 Requirements

Install dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or with conda:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate churn-prediction-env
```

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

```bash
python customer_churn_xgboost.py
```

└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── main.yml
```

## 📊 Model Results

- Accuracy: ~85-90% (depends on hyperparameters)
- XGBoost handles feature importance & class imbalance well
